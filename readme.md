# Sudoku Solver

Welcome to the world of Sudoku Solving! This project is designed to provide an efficient solution to the classic puzzle game of Sudoku. The project is implemented in C++ and uses Github for version control. The project is designed to solve all types of Sudoku problems with a single answer. The solver is timed and shows how much time it took to solve a problem. The board is read from a text file.

## Key Features

- Github is used for version control
- Bitmasking is used to decrease memory usage and speed up the process
- The best algorithms are used to solve problems
- Can solve all types of Sudoku problems with a single answer
- Timed and shows how much time it took to solve a problem
- Reads the board from a text file

## Bitmasking

Bitmasking is a technique used in computer science to manipulate bits of data. In this project, bitmasking is used to optimize memory usage and speed up the process. By using bitmasking, we can store data in a compact form, reducing the amount of memory needed to store the data. This results in faster processing and improved performance.

## Algorithms

The project uses the best algorithms to solve problems. The algorithms used in this project are carefully selected to ensure the best results. They are designed to find the solution quickly and efficiently, making sure that no time is wasted in finding the solution.

## Timing

The solver is timed and shows how much time it took to solve a problem. This allows you to see how fast the solver is and compare it to other solutions. The time is displayed in seconds, making it easy to compare different solutions.

## Reading the board from a text file

The board is read from a text file. This makes it easy to use the solver with different boards. Simply provide the path to the text file and the solver will read the board and solve the problem. The text file should contain the board in the following format:


## Example
input:
5 3 0 0 7 0 0 0 0
6 0 0 1 9 5 0 0 0
0 9 8 0 0 0 0 6 0
8 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 3
4 0 0 8 0 3 0 0 1
7 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 6
0 6 0 0 0 0 2 8 0
0 0 0 4 1 9 0 0 5
0 0 0 0 8 0 0 7 9

output:
5 3 4 6 7 8 9 1 2 
6 7 2 1 9 5 3 4 8 
1 9 8 3 4 2 5 6 7 
8 5 9 7 6 1 4 2 3 
4 2 6 8 5 3 7 9 1 
7 1 3 9 2 4 8 5 6 
9 6 1 5 3 7 2 8 4 
2 8 7 4 1 9 6 3 5 
3 4 5 2 8 6 1 7 9
